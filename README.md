# Version 0.1 20-09-13
# So far just a simple Hello World
# Couldn't work out how to get it working on Heroku
# To run locally, open the project in Visual Studio 2012, debug in Google Chrome
# When the browser opens loclhost, you'll get an error. At this point, append '/LifeCalc/' (with the capitals) to the end
# I'm sorry that I couldn't get further, had so many problems with Heroku that it is just not funny.
